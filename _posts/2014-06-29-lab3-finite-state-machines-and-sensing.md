Introduction
--------------

FSM (Finite State Machines) or simply state machine is a model to design computer 
programs. Most of robots use FSM to complete certain tasks. In this lab, you will
be using the iRobot's bumper sensors to define certain actions when the bumper 
sensors are triggered.


Preliminaries
--------------

This lab will involving FSM to control the iRobot to carry
out certain tasks. Use the instructions from the Getting Started lab in order to 
connect to the create base and launch the drivers except the keyboard driver. 

Finite State Machine
--------------

State machines are used in robot system; it is part of their overall strategy for 
accomplishing tasks. Usually, each state corresponds to a well-defined subtask, 
and the robot transitions from state to state depending on the input data 
sensors, etcâ€¦).

Examining the Sensor Messages
--------------

The ROS driver for the iRobot Create is publishing a stream of sensor data whenever 
its connected to the robot.To start, we'll use ROS's command-line tools in order 
to see the data stream that ROS is providing. These "data streams" we've been 
using are known as topics in ROS terminology.

	
	* At your Terminal run rostopic to see all the different ROS provided commands
	  related to topics.

		$ rostopic

	* In particular, run rostopic list to see all the topics available at the momment.
	  Which are the ones you are interested in.

		$ rostopic list

	* If you do not see the topic mobile_base/sensors/core, try reconnecting your
	  iRobot following the lab 1 commands.

	* To print the data flowing through Terminal, we will be using echo command.

		$ rostopic echo mobile_base/sensors/core

	* Try echoing the sensor messages and gently tap the bumpers of your iRobot.
	  This should trigger different sensor messages on your Terminal.

	* The bumper sensors can be found under the robot. It is labeled as "Contact Points 
	  for Home Base".

Sensor Subscribers
--------------

ROS's fundamental capability includes easy communication among distinct programs. 
Previously, we went over the communication using publisher. This lab will introduce 
to a different way of communication called subscriber.

	* If a program wants access to a streaming data, it uses subscriber to access them

The subscriber, like the word indicates, subscribes to a message to access the data. 
In this lab, we require the bumper sensor data. So previously, we saw the ROS topics 
through your Terminal, but those data printed on the Terminal is not necessary being 
used in the program. So in order to access the data, we use the subscriber in our codes 
to listen to the topics. The example of how subscribers are used is present on the 
skeleton code that is provided for you.

Returning to FSM
--------------

The example code includes few functions that make up the FSM itself. These functions
should include:

	* state_start

	* state_forward

	* state_backward

	* state_bumper_triggered

Read over the functions and determine the relationship among the states. The transition
between the states are triggered by external events, such as elapsed time or a sensor
trigger.

Lab Instructions
--------------

In this lab, you will be adding multiple states in order to carry out the task of
following the walls of this classroom. This task must be done through use of FSM.
The skeleton of the codes are provided in the Zip folders.
