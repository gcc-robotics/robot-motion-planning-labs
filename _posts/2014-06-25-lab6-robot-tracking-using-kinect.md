title: "Lab 6: Robot Tracking and Navigation Using Color Thresholding"
description: "In this lab, we will be enabling your robot to move to any position in the Kinect's view. We'll start off 
by first using a point selected by clicking on the screen and use visual servoing to arrive at that point."

This lab will involve...

Dressing Up Your Robot 
--------------

Now, to combine the color tracking that you have done previous with this lab, you should select a felt piece (of a 
different color from the people near you!) to place on your robot. Make sure that you can get the thresholds for this 
felt piece right, enabling you to track your robot as it goes across the screen.

Drive your robot around manually, and make sure that the thresholds still work while it's visible by the Kinect!
