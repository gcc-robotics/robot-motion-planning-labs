If you are using GCC Robotics Lab computers you can skip this lab and head 
strait over to Lab 1. This guide will be useful if you want to configure your 
personal laptop so you can continue working at home.

To be able to follow along with this series of labs you will need to have 
several prerequisites installed and configured on your computer. This lab will 
guide you through the process of getting all of the installed and configured 
correctly.

### Prerequisites

* Ubuntu 14.04
* ROS Indigo
* iRobot Create and Microsoft Kinect Drivers

Let's jump right in and start with Ubuntu.

### Setting Up Ubuntu

This series of labs was written specifically for Ubuntu 14.04 so you need to 
make sure that this is the version you are installing.

* [Download the Ubuntu 14.04 Desktop ISO][ubuntu-desktop-download]
* [Burn the downloaded ISO file to a DVD][ubuntu-dvd-burn-guide]
* [Follow the Ubuntu install guide][ubuntu-install-guide]

### Setting up ROS

Again this series of labs was written specifically for ROS Indigo Igloo so you 
need to make sure that this is the version you install.

Boot and login into your newly installed Ubuntu 14.04 Machine.

We will install ROS from the __Terminal__. The __Terminal__ is a text based 
input / output program which allows you to run different commands. You will 
learn more about the terminal in Lab 1.

Open the Terminal by Pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`
